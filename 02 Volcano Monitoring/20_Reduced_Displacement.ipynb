    "Seismometers are (usually) velocity transducers - they generate an electric signal (in Volts) that is proportional to the velocity of ground shaking within a certain passband. Outside that passband, the seismometer no longer generates a voltage proportional to ground velocity. This voltage signal has to be digitized (using an analog-to-digital converter built into the datalogger or on a computer at the observatory), converting the signal units from Volts to digitizer \"Counts\" before it can be examined on a computer. This is a raw seismic signal. To convert this raw seismic signal to a velocity seismogram, we must \"remove the instrument response\". Then by carefully integrating the velocity seismogram, we will have a displacement seismogram. So we have raw, velocity, and displacement, seismograms.\n",

    "\n",
    "How do we compare seismograms recorded at different distances from the same volcano? Or from different volcanoes? One thing we can do is to \"reduce\" the seismograms to a common distance, e.g. 1 km, by correcting for geometrical spreading. This is the idea behind Reduced Displacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple half-space velocity model of uniform density. As body waves propagate to greater distances, the wavefront can be thought of as a hemispherical shell, with surface area $2\\pi{r}^2$. If energy is not dissipated inelastically or scattered, the energy per unit area must then diminish $1/{r}^2$. And since amplitude is proportional to the square root of energy, the amplitude of body waves diminishes like 1/r. We call this \"geometrical spreading\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, surface waves can be thought of as a circular (or cylindrical) wavefront, whose circumference increases like $2\\pi r$, so energy density diminishes like 1/r and surface wave amplitude as $1/\\sqrt(r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Displacement was introduced by Aki & Koyanagi (1981) as a measurement of volcanic tremor amplitude for Kilaeua. Proportional to seismic moment rate, it is the RMS amplitude of a displacement seismogram, corrected for geometrical spreading. \n",
    "\n",
    "For body waves:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{R} = rms(U) r$\n",
    "\n",
    "where r = distance from source to station, U = displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond a few wavelengths, surface waves dominate, and Fehler (1983) determined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D_{RS} = rms(U) \\sqrt{r \\lambda}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a series of papers McNutt (1994; 2005; 2008) demonstrated scaling relationships for explosive volcanic eruptions between Reduced Displacement and:\n",
    "- ash column height\n",
    "- Volcanic Explosivity Index (Newhall and Self, 1982)\n",
    "- cross-sectional area of volcanic vent\n",
    "\n",

    "- For event 2, while the VLP bands show higher results, Whakaari is a small island, so the VLP energy likely comes from ocean noise. Again, we are at the local scale, so we accept 18.8 ${cm}^2$.\n",

    "- For event 4, station MSVF is about 760 km from Hunga Tonga, so surface waves dominate, and most of the signal is between 0.01 and 0.6 Hz. Is the $D_{RS}^{VLP}$ value of 39,000 ${cm}^2$ reasonable? \n",

    "Finally, there is a sort of \"magnitude scale\" for volcanic eruptions called the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), which similar to earthquake magnitude scales, runs from about 1 to 8. However, VEI is not an instrumental measurement, and instead is estimated from the volume of deposits found, and the height an ash column reaches, and other things. Hunga Tonga was estimated by different researchers to be either a VEI=5 or VEI=6 eruption, so if we fix that at VEI=5.5 and throw caution to the wind, here are instrumental VEI estimates for the other events above too:"
